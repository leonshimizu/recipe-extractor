## üöÄ Quick Start

### Prerequisites

- **Node.js 18+** - JavaScript runtime
- **[Neon Database](https://neon.tech)** - PostgreSQL database (free tier available)
- **[OpenAI API](https://platform.openai.com)** - For GPT-4o-mini and Whisper API
- **yt-dlp** - Video downloader (auto-installed via npm)

### Setup

1. **Clone and install:**
```bash
git clone https://github.com/leonshimizu/recipe-extractor.git
cd recipe-extractor/recipe-nextjs
npm install
```

2. **Environment Setup:**
```bash
# Create environment file
touch .env.local

# Add your API keys and database URL:
echo "DATABASE_URL=your_neon_database_url" >> .env.local
echo "OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_api_key" >> .env.local
# Optional: Only add if you want Instagram support
# echo "IG_OEMBED_TOKEN=your_instagram_token" >> .env.local
```

**Required Environment Variables:**
- `DATABASE_URL` - Your Neon PostgreSQL connection string
- `OPENAI_API_KEY` - OpenAI API key (needs GPT-4 and Whisper access)

**Optional Environment Variables:**
- `IG_OEMBED_TOKEN` - Instagram oEmbed token (only needed for Instagram video support)
  - Requires Facebook/Instagram Developer approval
  - Without this token, Instagram URLs will fail to process
  - Most users can skip this since Instagram only provides basic text extraction
  - **To get token**: Create Facebook Developer account ‚Üí Create app ‚Üí Get Instagram oEmbed access token

3. **Database Setup:**
```bash
npm run db:push
```

4. **Run Development:**

## üß† Technology Deep Dive

Ever wondered how we turn a cooking video into a structured recipe? Here's the simple breakdown of the technologies that make it possible:

### üé§ **OpenAI Whisper API - The "Ears" of the System**

**What it does:** Converts spoken words in videos into text (speech-to-text)

**How it works:**
1. We extract the audio track from a video (using yt-dlp)
2. Send the audio file to OpenAI's Whisper API
3. Whisper analyzes the sound waves and identifies spoken words
4. Returns a complete transcript of everything said in the video

**Why it's amazing:** Whisper can understand different accents, background noise, and even cooking terminology. It's like having super-human hearing that never misses an ingredient or step!

**Example:** Video says *"Add two tablespoons of olive oil and a pinch of salt"* ‚Üí Whisper returns `"Add two tablespoons of olive oil and a pinch of salt"`

### ü§ñ **OpenAI GPT-4o-mini - The "Brain" of the System**

**What it does:** Takes messy text and turns it into structured recipe data

**How it works:**
1. We give GPT-4o-mini the transcript + video title + description
2. We ask it to identify ingredients, steps, timing, and equipment
3. GPT-4o-mini uses its training on millions of recipes to understand cooking patterns
4. Returns organized data in a specific format (JSON)

**Why it's powerful:** GPT-4o-mini can infer missing information, estimate costs, calculate nutrition, and even fix common mistakes in the original video.

**Example:** 
- **Input:** *"So you're gonna want some flour, maybe like 2 cups, and then crack a couple eggs..."*
- **Output:** `{"ingredients": [{"quantity": "2", "unit": "cups", "name": "flour"}, {"quantity": "2", "unit": "whole", "name": "eggs"}]}`

### üîß **Vercel AI SDK - The "Translator" Between AI and Code**

**What it does:** Makes it easy to work with AI APIs and ensures we get reliable, structured responses

**How it works:**
1. We define a "schema" (like a template) for what a recipe should look like
2. The AI SDK sends our request to OpenAI with special instructions
3. It validates the AI's response to make sure it matches our template
4. If something's wrong, it automatically asks the AI to try again

**Why it's essential:** Without this, the AI might return data in random formats that our app can't understand. It's like having a translator who ensures the AI always "speaks" in the exact format our app expects.

**Example Schema:** "A recipe must have a title (text), ingredients (list), and steps (list)" - the AI SDK ensures we always get exactly this structure.

### üìπ **yt-dlp - The "Video Downloader" Tool**

**What it does:** Downloads videos and audio from YouTube, TikTok, and hundreds of other platforms

**How it works:**
1. You give it a video URL (like `youtube.com/watch?v=abc123`)
2. It figures out the platform and finds the actual video files
3. It can extract just the audio track (which we need for Whisper)
4. Downloads the audio as an MP3 file to our server

**Why we need it:** Social media platforms don't just give you direct access to video files. yt-dlp knows how to navigate each platform's system to get the actual media files.

**Fun fact:** yt-dlp supports over 1,000 different video platforms! It's like a universal key for video content.

### üîó **oEmbed APIs - The "Metadata Collectors"**

**What they do:** Get basic information about videos (title, thumbnail, description) without downloading the whole video

**How they work:**
1. Each platform (YouTube, TikTok, Instagram) provides an oEmbed endpoint
2. We send a video URL to their API
3. They return basic info like title, description, thumbnail image
4. This happens instantly (no video download needed)

**Why they're useful:** 
- **Fast**: Get video info in milliseconds
- **Lightweight**: No need to download large video files just for basic info
- **Reliable**: Official APIs provided by the platforms themselves

**Example:** Send `tiktok.com/video/123` ‚Üí Get back `{"title": "Amazing Pasta Recipe!", "thumbnail": "image.jpg", "description": "Easy 15-minute pasta..."}`

### üîÑ **How They All Work Together**

Here's the complete flow when you paste a video URL:

1. **oEmbed APIs** grab the video title, description, and thumbnail (fast)
2. **yt-dlp** downloads the audio track from the video (slower, but thorough)
3. **OpenAI Whisper** converts the audio into a complete transcript
4. **OpenAI GPT-4o-mini** analyzes all the text (title + description + transcript) and structures it into a recipe
5. **Vercel AI SDK** ensures the AI's response is properly formatted for our app
6. Our app saves everything to the database and shows you the final recipe!

**The magic:** Each tool does one thing really well, and together they transform a messy cooking video into a perfectly organized recipe! üéâ
